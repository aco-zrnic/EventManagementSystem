## Introduction
This project is a .NET 6-based event management system designed to help you organize and manage events efficiently. It includes authentication and authorization functionality powered by Auth0, and it leverages the Dependency Injection pattern using Autofac and Mediator for handling business logic. Additionally, it integrates with Netflix Conductor to manage and orchestrate workflows within the application.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization via Auth0.
- Event creation, editing, and deletion.
- Attendee registration and management for events.
- Stuff creation, editing, and deletion for events.
- Role-based access control for different user roles (admin, organizer, attendee).
- Mediator pattern for efficient and scalable communication between components.
- Netflix Conductor integration for workflow automation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) installed on your development machine.
- Auth0 account and API credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Domain).
- [Autofac](https://autofac.org/) and [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) packages added to your project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE.
3. Restore NuGet packages and build the solution.

## Configuration
1. Update the `appsettings.json` file with your configuration details:
   - Replace `<Auth0_Client_ID>`, `<Auth0_Client_Secret>`, and `<Auth0_Domain>` with your Auth0 credentials.
   - Configure other application-specific settings.
2. Configure Netflix Conductor integration by providing the Conductor API base URL and API key in the `appsettings.json` file.
   
## Authentication and Authorization
This project uses Auth0 for authentication and authorization. Ensure that you have created an Auth0 application and configured it accordingly. Update the Auth0 settings in your `appsettings.json` file.

## Dependency Injection
Autofac is used for Dependency Injection (DI) in this project. Make sure to register your services and components with Autofac in the `Startup.cs` file.

## Mediator Pattern
The Mediator pattern is employed for handling communication between different parts of the application. Commands and Queries are used to encapsulate and process requests efficiently. Make use of MediatR and define your commands and queries in the appropriate directories.

## Netflix Conductor
This project integrates with Netflix Conductor to manage and orchestrate workflows within the application. Follow the instructions in the Netflix Conductor Integration section to set up and use Netflix Conductor for workflow automation.
1.1 ##Monitoring and Management
Netflix Conductor provides a web-based UI for monitoring and managing your workflows. You can use this UI to track the progress of running workflows, view execution history, and troubleshoot any issues.
Ensure that your Conductor instance is accessible and properly configured for effective workflow management.
For more detailed documentation on using Netflix Conductor, please refer to the [Netflix Conductor documentation](https://conductor.netflix.com/documentation/api/index.html)
## Usage
1. Implement the required business logic, models, and controllers for your event management application.
2. Configure your database and ensure your data access code is integrated.
3. Use the provided authentication and authorization features for securing your application.
4. Test the application thoroughly, ensuring all features work as expected.
5. Deploy the application to your preferred hosting platform.
